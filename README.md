# Description
To put skill to practise, this application will help to demonstarte what flask can do creatively. The application provides GUI in terms of forms to collect user information
in forms. The information collected is therefore used in authentication and data access and manipulation in the postgresql.
the application has pitches that are customizable to categories that the user would like to have.

Also in the profile, the user is able to delete their own pitches if is authenticated
